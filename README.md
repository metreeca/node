# Metreeca/Tool

Metreeca/Tool is a modular React toolkit for rapid model-driven REST/JSON-LD client development.

Its components support declarative CRUD forms, infographics and self-service analytics leveraging model-driven
REST/JSON-LD APIs published with the [Metreeca/Base](https://github.com/metreeca/base) framework, relieving developers
from low-level chores and completely shielding them from linked data technicalities.

While collectively providing a floor-to-ceiling JSON-LD client development solution, its modules are loosely coupled and
may be easily plugged as a specialized component into your toolkit of choice.
