# Metreeca/Node

Metreeca/Node is a model‑driven Node/React framework for rapid REST/JSON‑LD development.

Its client modules support declarative model‑driven React interfaces, infographics and self-service analytics built on
top of model‑driven REST/JSON‑LD APIs published either with the (upcoming…) integrated Node.js server modules or the
the [Metreeca/Java](https://github.com/metreeca/java) framework.

While collectively providing a floor-to-ceiling fulls‑stack development solution, Metreeca/Node modules are loosely
coupled and may be easily plugged as a specialized component into your toolkit of choice.
